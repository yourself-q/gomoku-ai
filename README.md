# Gomoku AI Project [![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/yourself-q/gomoku-ai)

This project aims to create a self-learning Gomoku AI model with the following components:
1. A Gomoku game implementation
2. An AI model for playing Gomoku
3. A GUI for displaying the game and training progress
4. Functions for fighting against models
5. Self-reinforcement mechanisms (model vs. model and model vs. human)

## Project Structure

- `game/`: Core Gomoku game implementation
- `ai/`: AI models for playing Gomoku
- `gui/`: Graphical user interface components
- `training/`: Training and reinforcement learning code

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the GUI

```bash
python gui/main.py
```

### Training the AI Model

```bash
python training/train.py
```
